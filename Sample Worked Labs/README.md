# This  Java_Basics repo;
Is a group of java programing Laboratories and examples worked on during the Programming Basics Class.

------------------
# Requirements for Testing and Use.
* We used the IntelliJ IDEA [get it here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?fromIDE=#section=windows) if you are not using your favourite one.

------------------
# How we have Organised the Repo. 
* The Question are in the files named Lab_No_Questions(pdf format or text format),
and the Solutions to that lab are also numbered like that.
* So for example if we have Lab_05_Question.pdf,it is for Lab_05, 
we will have Lab_05_01_Solution, to mean the solution to Lab_05_Question_01.
* For purposes of ease, of usage and testing for our convenience ,kindly please follow the numbering.

# What we have Worked on (and will add).
* Checking if Given Points Make a Triangle.
* Checking the Type of Triangle.Checking if the Triangle is an Isosceles Triangle or Scalene or Equilateral Triangle.
* Adding and Merging all the Solutions of the Lab Question into one file.
